### Prerequisites

This course assumes very little background in programming and mathematics, and you can learn the required concepts here:

- Basic programming with Python ([variables](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/first-steps-with-python), [data types](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-variables-and-data-types), [loops](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-branching-and-loops), [functions](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-functions-and-scope) etc.)
- Some high school mathematics ([polynomials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm7H0VTlIco), [vectors, matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oGJTQCy4cQ&list=PLSQl0a2vh4HCs4zPpOEdF2GuydqS90Yb6) and [probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzkc-qNVoOk))
- No prior knowledge of data structures or algorithms is required

We'll cover any additional mathematical and theoretical concepts we need as we go along.

## How to Run the Code

The best way to learn the material is to execute the code and experiment with it yourself. This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.

#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)

The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select "Run on Colab" or "Run on Kaggle", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.


#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally

To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.

## Problem 


In this notebook, we'll focus on solving the following problem:

> **QUESTION 1**: As a senior backend engineer at Jovian, you are tasked with developing a fast in-memory data structure to manage profile information (username, name and email) for 100 million users. It should allow the following operations to be performed efficiently:
> 
> 1. **Insert** the profile information for a new user.
> 2. **Find** the profile information of a user, given their username
> 3. **Update** the profile information of a user, given their usrname
> 5. **List** all the users of the platform, sorted by username
>
> You can assume that usernames are unique. 

Along the way, we will also solve several other questions related to binary trees and binary search trees that are often asked in coding interviews and assessments.

## The Method


Here's a systematic strategy we'll apply for solving problems:

1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.
6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.

## 1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.

#### Problem

> We need to create a data structure which can store 100 million records and perform insertion, search, update and list operations efficiently.

#### Input

The key inputs to our data structure are user profiles, which contain the username, name and email of a user. 

A Python _class_ would be a great way to represent the information for a user. A class is a blueprint for creating _objects_. Everything in Python is an _object_ belonging to some _class_. Here's the simples possible class in Python, with nothing in it:
"""

class User:
    pass

"""We can create or _instantiate_ an object of the class by calling it like a function."""

user1 = User()

"""We can verify that the object is of the class `User`."""

user1

type(user1)

"""The object `user1` does not contain any useful information. Let's add a _constructor method_ to the class to store some _attributes_ or _properties_."""

class User:
    def __init__(self, username, name, email):
        self.username = username
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        print('User created!')

"""We can now create an object with some properties."""

user2 = User('john', 'John Doe', 'john@doe.com')

user2

"""Here's what's happening above (conceptually):

- Python creates an empty object of the type user and stores in the variable `user2`
- Python then invokes the function `User.___init__` with the arguments `user2`, `"john"`, `"John Doe"` and `"john@doe.com"`
- As the `__init__` function is executed, the properties `username`, `name` and `email` are set on the object `user2`

We can access the properties of the object using the `.` notation.
"""

user2.name

user2.email, user2.username

"""You can also define custom methods inside a class."""

class User:
    def __init__(self, username, name, email):
        self.username = username
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
    
    def introduce_yourself(self, guest_name):
        print("Hi {}, I'm {}! Contact me at {} .".format(guest_name, self.name, self.email))

user3 = User('jane', 'Jane Doe', 'jane@doe.com')

user3.introduce_yourself('David')

"""When we try to invoke the method `user3.introduce_yourself`, the object `user3` is automatically passed as the first argument `self`. Indeed, the following statement is equivalent to the above statement."""

User.introduce_yourself(user3, 'David')

"""Finally, we'll define a couple of helper methods to display user objects nicely within Jupyter."""

class User:
    def __init__(self, username, name, email):
        self.username = username
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return "User(username='{}', name='{}', email='{}')".format(self.username, self.name, self.email)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.__repr__()

user4 = User('jane', 'Jane Doe', 'jane@doe.com')

user4

"""**Exercise:** What is the purpose of defining the functions `__str__` and `__repr__` within a class? How are the two functions different? Illustrate with some examples using the empty cells below.

"""#### Output

We can also express our desired data structure as a Python class `UserDatabase` with four methods: `insert`, `find`, `update` and `list_all`.

        pass

"""It's good programming practice to list out the signatures of different class functions before we actually implement the class.

## 2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. 

Let's create some sample user profiles that we can use to test our functions once we implement them.

"""We can access different fields within a user profile object using the `.` (dot) notation."""

biraj.username, biraj.email, biraj.name

"""We can also view a string representation of the object, since defined the `__repr__` and `__str__` methods"""

print(aakash)

users

"""Since we haven't implemented our data structure yet, it's not possible to list sample outputs. However you can try to come up with different scenarios to test future implementations

**Exercise:** List some scenarios for testing the class methods `insert`, `find`, `update` and `list_all`.

1. Insert:
    1. Inserting into an empty database of users
    2. Trying to insert a user with a username that already exists
    3. Inserting a user with a username that does not exist

2. Find:

4. List:
    1. ???
    2. ???
    3. ???

## 3. Come up with a correct solution. State it in plain English.

Here's a simple and easy solution to the problem: we store the `User` objects in a list sorted by usernames. 

The various functions can be implemented as follows:

1. **Insert**: Loop through the list and add the new user at a position that keeps the list sorted.
2. **Find**: Loop through the list and find the user object with the username matching the query.
3. **Update**: Loop through the list, find the user object matching the query and update the details
4. **List**: Return the list of user objects.

We can use the fact usernames, which are are strings can be compared using the `<`, `>` and `==` operators in Python.

"""## 4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs.

The code for implementing the above solution is also fairly straightfoward.

**Exercise:** Use the empty cells below to test the various scenarios you listed in step 2 above.

"""## 5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies

The operations `insert`, `find`, `update` involves iterating over a list of users, in the worst case, they may take up to `N` iterations to return a result, where `N` is the total number of users. `list_all` however, simply returns the existing internal list of users. 

Thus, the time complexities of the various operations are:

1. Insert: **O(N)**
2. Find: **O(N)**
3. Update: **O(N)**
4. List: **O(1)**

**Exercise:** Verify that the space complexity of each operation is **O(1)**.

Is this good enough? To get a sense how long each function might take if there are 100 million users on the platform, we can simply run an `for` or `while` loop on 10 million numbers.
"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %%time
# for i in range(100000000):
#     j = i*i

"""It takes almost 10 seconds to execute all the iterations in the above cell. 

* A 10-second delay for fetching user profiles will lead to a suboptimal users experience and may cause many users to stop using the platform altogether. 
* The 10-second processing time for each profile request will also significantly limit the number of users that can access the platform at a time or increase the cloud infrastructure costs for the company by millions of dollars.

As a senior backend engineer, you must come up with a more efficient data structure! Choosing the right data structure for the requirements at hand is an important skill. It's apparent that a sorted list of users might not be the best data structure to organize profile information for millions of users.

"""## 6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency

We can limit the number of iterations required for common operations like find, insert and update by organizing our data in the following structure, called a **binary tree**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lVqP63n.png" width="520">



It's called a tree because it vaguely like an inverted tree trunk with branches. 
* The word "binary" indicates that each "node" in the tree can have at most 2 children (left or right). 
* Nodes can have 0, 1 or 2 children. Nodes that do not have any children are sometimes also called "leaves".
* The single node at the top is called the "root" node, and it typically where operations like search, insertion etc. begin.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TZHMKJr.png" width="400">

## Balanced Binary Search Trees

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Mqef5b3.png" width="520">

For our use case, we require the binary tree to have some additional properties:

1. **Keys and Values**: Each node of the tree stores a key (a username) and a value (a `User` object). Only keys are shown in the picture above for brevity. A binary tree where nodes have both a key and a value is often referred to as a **map** or **treemap** (because it maps keys to values).
2. **Binary Search Tree**: The *left subtree* of any node only contains nodes with keys that are lexicographically smaller than the node's key, and the *right subtree* of any node only contains nodes with keys that lexicographically larger than the node's key. A tree that satisfies this property is called a **binary search trees**, and it's easy to locate a specific key by traversing a single path down from the root note.
3. **Balanced Tree**: The tree is **balanced** i.e. it does not skew too heavily to one side or the other. The left and right subtrees of any node shouldn't differ in height/depth by more than 1 level.


### Height of a Binary Tree

The number of levels in a tree is called its height. As you can tell from the picture above, each level of a tree contains twice as many nodes as the previous level. 

For a tree of height `k`, here's a list of the number of nodes at each level:

Level 0: `1`

Level 1: `2`

Level 2: `4` i.e. `2^2`

Level 3: `8` i.e. `2^3`

...

Level k-1: `2^(k-1)`

If the total number of nodes in the tree is `N`, then it follows that

```
N = 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)
```


We can simplify this equation by adding `1` on each side:

```
N + 1 = 1 + 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1) 

N + 1 = 2^1 + 2^1 + 2^2+ 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1) 

N + 1 = = 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)

N + 1 = = 2^3 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)

...

N + 1 = 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-1)

N + 1 = 2^k

k = log(N + 1) <= log(N) + 1 

```

Thus, to store `N` records we require a balanced binary search tree (BST) of height no larger than `log(N) + 1`. This is a very useful property, in combination with the fact that nodes are arranged in a way that makes it easy to find a specific key by following a single path down from the root. 

As we'll see soon, the `insert`, `find` and `update` operations in a balanced BST have time complexity `O(log N)` since they all involve traversing a single path down from the root of the tree.

## Binary Tree

> **QUESTION 2**: Implement a binary tree using Python, and show its usage with some examples.

To begin, we'll create simple binary tree (without any of the additional properties) containing numbers as keys within nodes. Here's an example:

"""## Self-Balancing Binary Trees and AVL Trees

A *self-balancing binary tree* remains balanced after every insertion or deletion. Several decades of research has gone into creating self-balancing binary trees, and many approaches have been devised e.g. B-trees, Red Black Trees and  AVL (Adelson-Velsky Landis) trees.

We'll take a brief look at AVL trees. Self-balancing in AVL trees is achieved by tracking the *balance factor* (difference between the height of the left subtree and the right subtree) for each node and *rotating* unbalanced subtrees along the path of insertion/deletion to balance them.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/AVL_Tree_Example.gif)

In a balanced BST, the balance factor of each node is either 0, -1, or 1. When we perform an insertion, then the balance factor of certain nodes along the path of insertion may change to 2 or -2. Those nodes can be "rotated" one-by-one to bring the balance factor back to 1, 0 or -1. 

There are 4 different scenarios for balancing, two of which require a single rotation, while the others require 2 rotations:


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/0/1436854305-b167cc766c-AVL_Tree_Rebalancing.svg.png)

Source: [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/self-balancing-tree/problem)

Since each rotation takes constant time, and at most `log N` rotations may be required, this operation is far more efficient than creating a balanced binary tree from scratch, allowing insertion and deletion to be performed in `O (log N)` time. Here are some references for AVL Trees:

* Explanation of the various cases: https://youtu.be/jDM6_TnYIqE?t=482
* Implementation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/avl-tree-set-1-insertion/

## Summary and Exercises

![](https://i.imgur.com/lVqP63n.png)

Binary trees form the basis of many modern programming language features (e.g. maps in C++ and Java) and data storage systems (filesystem indexes, relational databases like MySQL). You might wonder if dictionaries in Python are also binary search trees. They're not. They're hash tables, which is a different but equally interesting and important data structure. We'll explore hash tables in a future tutorial.






We've covered a lot of ground this in this tutorial, including several common interview questions. Here are a few more problems you can try out:

1. Implement rotations and self-balancing insertion
1. Implement deletion of a node from a binary search tree
2. Implement deletion of a node from a BST (with balancing)
3. Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree (Hint: Use the `parent` property)
4. Find the next node in lexicographic order for a given node
5. Given a number k, find the k-th node in a BST.
