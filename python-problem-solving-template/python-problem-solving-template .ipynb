# ## How to run the code and save your work
# 
# The recommended way to run this notebook is to click the "Run" button at the top of this page, and select "Run on Binder". This will run the notebook on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks. 
# 
# This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.
# 
# #### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)
# 
# The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select "Run on Colab" or "Run on Kaggle", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.
# 
# 
# #### Option 2: Running on your computer locally
# 
# To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.

# #### Saving your work
# 
# Before staring the assignment, let's save a snapshot of the assignment to your [Jovian](https://jovian.ai) profile, so that you can access it later, and continue your work.

project_name = "Check if both string have same alphabets(hashtable)" # give it an appropriate name


# In[4]:

# ## Problem Statement
# 
# 
# > Check if both string have same alphabets and the length of the string is same
# 
# 
# Source: ??? (link to the source)

# ## The Method
# 
# Here's the systematic strategy we'll apply for solving problems:
# 
# 1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
# 2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
# 3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
# 4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
# 5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.
# 6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.
# 
# This approach is explained in detail in [Lesson 1](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python/lesson/lesson-1-binary-search-linked-lists-and-complexity) of the course. Let's apply this approach step-by-step.

# ## Solution
# 
# 
# ### 1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
# 
# While this problem is stated clearly enough, it's always useful to try and express in your own words, in a way that makes it most clear for you. 
# 
# 
# **Problem**
# 
# >In this we take 2 string as a input and check if that the length and the characters of both strings are same.
# <br/>
# 
# 
# **Input**
# 
# 1. String1
# 2. String2
# 
# (add more if required)
# 
# 
# **Output**
# 
# 1. Boolean
# 
# 
# (add more if required)
# 
# <br/>
# 
# Based on the above, we can now create a signature of our function:

# In[7]:


def are_same1(s1,s2):
    pass


# Save and upload your work before continuing.

# In[8]:


import jovian


# In[9]:


jovian.commit()


# ### 2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
# 
# Our function should be able to handle any set of valid inputs we pass into it. Here's a list of some possible variations we might encounter:
# 
#  1. Strings with different characters .
#  2. Strings with different length.
#  3. strings with exact same word.
#  4. strings with same characters*
# 
# (add more if required)
# 
# 
# We'll express our test cases as dictionaries, to test them easily. Each dictionary will contain 2 keys: `input` (a dictionary itself containing one key for each argument to the function and `output` (the expected result from the function). 

# In[11]:


test0 = {
    'input': {
        's1': "rats",
        's2': "soup"
    },
    'output': False
}

#Strings with different characters .
# Strings with different length.
test1 = {
    'input': {
        's1': "rat",
        's2': "soup"
    },
    'output': False
}


# In[48]:


# Strings with exact same word.
test2 = {
    'input': {
        's1': "rat",
        's2': "rat"
    },
    'output': True
}


# In[49]:


# Strings with same characters
test3= {
    'input': {
        's1': "study",
        's2': "dusty"
    },
    'output': True
}


# Create one test case for each of the scenarios listed above. We'll store our test cases in an array called `tests`.

# In[12]:


tests = [test0,test1,test2,test3]


# In[ ]:


tests.append(test)


# In[ ]:


tests.append({
    'input': {
        ???
    },
    'output': ???
})


# In[ ]:


# add more test cases


# In[ ]:





# ### 3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
# 
# Our first goal should always be to come up with a _correct_ solution to the problem, which may not necessarily be the most _efficient_ solution. Come with a correct solution and explain it in simple words below:
# 
#  1. Take 2 string as a input.
#  2. Check if both strings length is same.
#  3. then take element as a key of both string.
#  4. Check if both the strings key's value are correct.
#  5. If all the condition pass then returns True
# 
# (add more steps if required)
# 
# 
# Let's save and upload our work before continuing.

        if ch in word1:
            word1[ch]+=1

        else :

    for key in word1:

    return True

# We can test the function by passing the input to it directly or by using the `evaluate_test_case` function from `jovian`.
